// Varenholm's Gate story campaign — every line, choice and epilogue paragraph.
// Text only in this pass: no clips exist yet, so nothing here is walked by
// vo_coverage. VARENHOLMS_GATE_VOICE_SCRIPT.md is generated from this file.
//
// Register: sincere, unhurried, a little formal — the classic CRPG voice.
// Every named person speaks from a region (see CAMPAIGN3_REGIONS in
// campaign3_data.js): the accent lives in word choice, rhythm and idiom, never
// in phonetic spelling, so TTS stays intelligible.
//
// How scenes are built: nobody in this script explains the world for its own
// sake. Each person wants something and works the scene for it — companions
// put their own questions to the people you meet (gated on who is riding
// along), the people you meet ask you things and read your answer, and two
// strangers sharing a scene argue with each other before they turn to you.
// The player is silent: the only lines they "say" are the options they pick.
// Options marked `ask` are questions — the answer plays and the same choice
// returns without that question. Options that answer an NPC's question do not
// return. Bracketed tags are ElevenLabs v3 delivery cues (spoken, never shown).
// {target} is the listener's name.

    monster: `Kolade Adeyinka died at the altar and the city cheered you for it. They did not see what you saw in his eyes when the chair was empty, and they do not know that some nights you go back down the stairs alone to look at it.`,
    usurper: `You sat down. It was warm. Amara left the city; Layla did not. The Council thanked you, the war was never declared, and the shape-thieves in the sewers have started calling you by a title you did not choose.`,
